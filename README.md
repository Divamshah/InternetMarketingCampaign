# InternetMarketingCampaign

Blendo Games, is a boutique gaming company based out of Los Angeles, California. The company
creates and sells independent video games for use on PC, Mac, Linux, and Xbox360.The company’s main website is http://blendogames.com/ and enables customers to purchase
games directly from the site and provides links to related blogs, game updates, latest news and social
media. Blendo Games operates in the Independent video game niche space typically referred to as
“indie games”. The website has
good visibility when words that are part of Blendo’s games names are searched specifically. This means
that there is a very good connection between the word and the company’s website since the name of
the games could potentially mean different things. However, when customers search using generic
words such as “video games,” the website does not appear. To increase its revenue, in 2010, Blendo
Games adopted Pay per click advertising across a number of publishers, Google, MSN, Overture, and
Yahoo. Separate campaigns were run across these publishers and these campaigns did increase the
revenue of Blendo Games. At this time, the management of Blendo Games has hired you to optimize its
internet marketing campaigns. They have provided you their detailed PPC report and want you to help
them with the following questions:

1. Which publisher is providing the highest Return on Advertising (ROA) Dollar?
2. Does Google require an improvement on search side copy? Why/Why Not?
3. Does Yahoo require an improvement on website side copy? Why/Why Not?
4. The company intends to increase funding for Yahoo but decrease funding for MSN because Yahoo
has a decent CTR but MSN has the lowest CTR among all publishers. Would you support this decision?
Why/Why not?
5. The company expects that the exact match and phrase match keywords would provide higher ROA
compared to broad match keywords. While updating their strategy they are thinking about bidding
on only exact and phrase match keywords. Would you support this decision? Why/Why Not?
6. The company feels that global audience (targeted through Google ‐Global, MSN Global and Yahoo ‐
Global) does not purchase the products from it and wishes to know if it is worthwhile to still invest
in advertising to global audience. What do you recommend?
7. Would the search side strategies that the company should employ be different for US audience and
Global audience? Please explain what the strategies should be.
8. What strategies would you suggest for improving performance for each of the publishers?
